# Introduction
Welcome to the first Learner's Notes! We're attempting to dive into Folly's RCU with a side of my confusion and possibly some suffering. In this three-part saga, we'll try to unravel the mystery of Follyâ€™s implementation of RCU. In Part 1, we tackle the basics of RCU and take a peek at what C++26 requirements for it. But first, what the heck is RCU?

# What is RCU?
RCU, or Read-Copy-Update, is a synchronization mechanism that shines in read-heavy scenarios. An important thing to note is that it does not provide mutual exclusion, but instead helps user schdule specified actions at some time later. First popping up in the Linux Kernel, it is utilised as a safe memory reclamation.

But what's so special about it? Unlike reader-writer locks, RCU supports concurrency between a single updater and multiple readers. It helps ensure coherent reads and that no memory is freed up until all read-side critical sections are completed. The main idea is splitting
